👋 Hi there! I'm @Kuhjuice.

👀 I have a passion for Biotechnology, Machine Learning, and IT Security.

🌱 Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of machine learning techniques and exploring the fundamentals of electrotechnology. (I'm also secretly working on some exciting PCB projects, but shhh, that's our little secret 😉).

💞️ I'm eager to collaborate on LoRa hardware projects and applying machine learning to datasets for specific and innovative projects.

📫 You can reach me via email at "bo@blackscript.de".
